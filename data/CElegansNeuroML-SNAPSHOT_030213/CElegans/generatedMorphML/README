NOTE: This folder is not normally generated by a neuroConstruct project!!

This is included here to give access to the CElegans cells in MorphML format, i.e. with root <morphml> element.

The source for these cells is in the ../morphologies folder, these MorphML files were generated through the nC GUI
at tab Export -> NeuroML -> NeuroML v1.x -> Export all Cell Types, with option Level 1 selected
