Some test scripts for parsing Stephen Cook's SQL database dumps.

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/14lN2jjG2thCnVyBSABbMtEWOWCXdYTCn22erb7Wxujo/edit# for background

Steps to get this far (on Ubuntu 12.04):

1) Obtained JSH.sql from previous email exchange

2) Tried loading that directly into sqlite3, no go, since too much mysql specific entries there

3) Installed mysql onto local machine, used mysqlnavigator to browse existing databases, created new database JSH,
   ran script JSH.sql against this to populate that with data.

4) Obtained mysql2sqlite.sh from https://raw.github.com/gist/1287049/mysql2sqlite.sh. Ran command:

      ./mysql2sqlite.sh -u root -p JSH > JSH_sqlite.sql

5) Now JSH data can be loaded in sqlite with:

      sqlite3 JSH_sqlite.sql

   or browsed with sqlitebrowser

6) Created parseDB.py to use Python API to extract info from the sqlite database:

      python parseDB.py

   which can execute SQL commands like: 'SELECT * FROM image'
