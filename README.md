Analysis of the C. Elegans connectome

## Connectomes

## TODO
- [ ] Define the strengh associated with every synapse.
- [ ] Check the correlation between the communities extracted and the Neurotransmitter released by each vertex
- [ ] Check other networks
- [ ] Did the initial project of C.Elegans robot takes into account the type of neurotransmitter?
